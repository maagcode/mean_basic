## MEAN Basic starter application

This is a basic application with database and user authentication implementation
built with MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.JS, Angular.JS and NODE.JS).

The mean purpose of the application is to start getting my hands on web development
using MEAN.

I will keep all changes updated, and notify when the app is fully functional and
ready to clone.

Happy coding !!!!
